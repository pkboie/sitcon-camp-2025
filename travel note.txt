taipei 101

OMG, 101 is seriously TALL! My ears were popping like crazy in the elevator, but the view was totally worth it. Looking down from the 89th floor, the whole city looked like LEGO blocks, and cars were like tiny ants crawling around.
The coolest part? That massive golden wind damper ball swinging around! The staff said it's the building's secret weapon to prevent crazy swaying. Felt like something straight out of a sci-fi movie!
The shopping mall was pretty decent too - luxury brands everywhere, but RIP my wallet. The xiaolongbao in the basement food court was amazing though, way cheaper than the fancy restaurants upstairs.
I bet the night view would be even more spectacular! Heard the New Year's fireworks are absolutely mind-blowing. Definitely coming back on December 31st!
